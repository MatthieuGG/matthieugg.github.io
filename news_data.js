      <p>New section on this website! 
      I'll post here science-related news: research, clinic, teaching, congress, projects, social events, etc. 
      I also took the opportunity to refresh the website, including the implementation of a 
      <a href="https://matthieugg.github.io/resume.html">dynamic PDF reader</a> for my (updated) resume.</p>

      <p>No "likes", no react, no comments, just a specific oriented information diffusion. 
      So little that no newsletter would make sense, at least for now. 
      Inspired by <a href="https://calnewport.com/writing/">digital minimalism</a>, with text and few media.  
      A good start for decentralised internet, using less 
      <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/matthieu-gallou-guyot">LinkedIn</a> and 
      <a href="https://jp.linkedin.com/in/matthieu-gallou-guyot">ResearchGate</a>, maybe?</p>
