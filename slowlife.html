    <p>Technological tools and services are designed to be attractive: colorful, smart, easy to use, and accessible. They're addictive by design.</p>
    <p>What social networks present to you is a curated and distorted reality, reflecting back biased views.</p>
    <p>The internet is endless, always offering new trends and content, trapping you in the culture of the instant.</p>
    <p>We can't live in the present, archive it, and consume the past all at once. It's a losing race.</p>
    <p>We endure constant media overexposure, with mostly negative news. You deserve digital silence and important updates.</p>
    <p>Focus is increasingly difficult; our attention spans are dwindling. You have something in mind, check your phone, don't remember what you intended to do, and lock it with a fuzzy feeling.</p>
    <p>You can no longer stand being bored for more than a few seconds, and pleasures seem fleeting and bland to you.</p>
    <p>The more you strive for rest, the more exhausted you feel. Efforts often backfire.</p>
    <p>The key to work-life balance lies in efficiency. Reduce working hours rather than chasing more tasks.</p>
    <p><strong>But tech is everywhere, and is a powerfull gift - so, what can you do?</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Embrace the power of boredom. Allow your brain to rest, think, and create without constant stimuli.</li>
      
      <li>Rediscover handwriting and note-taking.</li>
        <li>Books and data servers can store and maintain much more data than you can. Human added value is thinking.</li>
      <li>Print materials for reading; it's kinder to your eyes and mind.</li>
      <li>Opt for phone calls over texts for deeper, more meaningful communication.</li>
      <li>Learn to ignore immediate demands; responding less reduces future obligations (emails, texts, etc.).</li>
      <li>Differentiate between priorities and urgencies. And between yours and theires.</li>
      <li>"Less is more" â€” focus on quality over quantity. Learn to say "no" and avoid the "hyperproductivity" rat race.</li>
      <li>Switch your phone to grayscale mode.</li>
      <li>Separate functions on different tools. And above all, separate the professional from the personal.</li>
      <li>Use a paper agenda and a basic wristwatch.</li>          
      <li>Install an old-fashioned FM radio in your living spaces.</li>
      <li>Check your email only once a day, for a set duration. Don't let your mail box open. And avoid "instant messages".</li>
      <li>Keep your phone out of the bedroom and away from your workspace. Actually, don't even put it in your pocket</li>
      <li>Switch off every notifications, except for phone calls.</li>
      <li>Avoid multi tasking - always do one thing at a time. Don't answer emails in meetings, don't listen to podcasts while walking, and never eat in front of a screen.</li>
      <li>Avoid shortcuts like Bluetooth earbuds or sped-up content.</li>
      <li>Disconnect your WiFi when not needed.</li>
      <li>Set app usage limits and have someone else set the unlock code.</li>
      <li>Never consult passively the never-ending scroling plateforms. No mindless scrolling on social media.</li>
        <li>And never, ever go with "gacha".</li>
      <li>Use social media for broadcasting, not consuming.</li>
      <li>Stop screen use an hour before bed; read instead.</li>
      <li>Set durations for tasks and optimize efficiency. Always start by defining a duration - as short as possible.</li>
      <li>Start the day with the most challenging task, and end it with a small, achievable goal.</li>
      <li>Consider walking meetings.</li>
      <li>Invest in a standing desk and a swiss ball.</li>
      <li>Use the "3, 2, 1" technique to start tasks. You can even try Pomodoro.</li>
      <li>Break tasks into smaller, manageable steps. </li>
      <li>Shorten meeting durations. And stick to the schedule.</li>
      <li>Commit fully to decisions to avoid regrets.</li>
      <li>Completion, not perfection, is the goal. A good job is a done job.</li>
      <li>Maintain clean, organized workspaces.</li>
      <li>Solicit fresh perspectives from newcomers.</li>
      <li>Challenge yourself to recall information rather than instantly searching for answers - don't ask Google or GPT in a second.</li>
      <li>When decisions are tough, flip a coin for clarity.</li>
      <li>Practice mindfulness through any repetitive and not too cognitive-demanding physical activities.</li>
      <li>Starting is the hardest part; minimize breaks that disrupt flow. And don't let people interupt you.</li>
      <li>Take power naps (15 minutes maximum).</li>
      <li>Prioritize early sleep and wake times for physical tiredness and cognitive freshness.</li>
      <li>Engage in physical activities and eat mindfully with plenty of water.</li>
      <li>Begin your day actively, perhaps standing while eating.</li>
        <li>Life is not a race. Space out the experiences, give yourself time to store them.</li>
        <li>It's even easier to go without any "smart-" or "connected-" things. You don't have to go back to dumb phone: try "distraction-free phone".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The main ideas are yo reduce the efforts, be more active, take back control, and do things because you want to, not because it's part of your routine (or even compulsive).</p>
    <p><em>Those are just advices from my own experience. If you want references, books and studies, there are more than you can ever read. Test, adjust, do your own thing. Be self-conscious, curious and critical.</em></p>
