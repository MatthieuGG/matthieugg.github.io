    <p>Technological tools and services are conceptualised to be attractive. They are colorfull, as convenient as smart, easy to use and to access. You get addicted by design.</p>
    <p>What is presented to you through social networks is a selected and distorted reality. You are facing distorting mirrors and confirmation bias.</p>
    <p>Internet never ends. There will always be new trends, new content. You get stuck in the culture of the moment.</p>
    <p>We cannot simultaneously live in the present, archive it and consume the past. You are already loosing a rat race.</p>
    <p>We live in imposed overexposure to media hubbub. You deserve digital silence.</p>
    <p>It is more difficult each day to focus on the same task for a period. Youre attention capacities are melting.</p>
    <p>The more you rest, the more you feel exhausted. Your are lacking of power, and everything you tentatively do to gain some ends the opposite.</p>
    <p>We cannot simultaneously live in the present, archive it and consume the past.</p>
    <p><strong>So, what to do?</strong></p>
