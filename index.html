        <!-- BIO -->
         <br>
        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
            I am a French researcher with a keen interest in rehabilitation, sports science, and neuroscience.
            As a physiotherapist, I work at the intersection of applied clinical practice and data-driven research.
            Curious and mobile, I have lived and worked in France and Japan.
            Animal lover, I am also an avid sports enthusiast, especially when it comes to outdoor activities and martial arts.
        </p>
        <p>
            I specialized in the field of <strong>active aging</strong>, with a more clinical than fundamental approach. 
            I am interested in issues related to maintaining autonomy and combating frailty, such as cognitive-motor inference or fear of falling. 
            I use gamified approaches, sometimes relying on the use of exergaming or actimetry technologies.
        </p>
        <p>            
            For more detailed and up-to-date information about my work, please refer to <a href="resume.html"><strong>my resume</strong></a>.
            You can also get my last updates from the <a href="news.html"><strong>news</strong></a> section.
            Feel free to contact me for any questions, discussions, or collaboration opportunities!

        <!-- RESEARCH -->
        <br>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
            I strongly believe in the value of translational and impactful clinical research.
            With this in mind, I am committed to scientific communication — both for specialized audiences and the general public — and actively engaged in open science initiatives.
            I shortly introduce my past and current projects below; you'll find all related work in the <a href="productions.html"><strong>productions</strong></a> section.

                As a postdoc at The University of Tokyo, I investigate brain activity measured through <strong>fMRI</strong>.
                The objective is to assess whether and how the presentation of different stimuli—under unimodal versus multimodal conditions—
                could enhance the prediction accuracy of various encoding and decoding models.
                <em>This is an ongoing project; results are forthcoming.</em>
                The intensive use of machine learning tools allowed me to acquire valuable skills, most of which are openly available on GitHub

                is an international collaboration between Dakar, Lyon, and Tokyo, which I joined as a postdoc at Ochanomizu University.
                From 2019 to 2025, we recruited more than 100 patients with sickle-cell anemia in Dakar and assessed the impact of their physical activity behavior
                on various biomedical factors, including inflammation and pain markers.
                So far, the intensity of physical activity does not appear to be associated with the severity of clinical adverse events 
                <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjh.20150"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.
                If confirmed, these findings could have important implications for future care by encouraging physical activity in this population.

                From 2019 to 2022, we conceptualized, developed, and evaluated the effectiveness of a personalized exergame 
                <a href="https://osf.io/kt54b/"><sup>[1]</sup></a> targeting the cognitive-motor abilities of older adults.
                This <strong>INCOME</strong> project was part of <a href="https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03715392">my PhD</a> at HAVAE,
                and involved 3 facilitators, 40 participants, and several students.
                Overall, we found that our exergame was effective in enhancing cognitive functions and maintaining motor skills in older adults 
                <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2023.1046676"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.
                Most importantly, we showed that this tailored solution was well-received by all users—both players and facilitators 
                <a href="https://doi.org/10.25965/TRAHS.3945"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.
                These results are even more relevant considering they were obtained during the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdowns.

        <h2>Teaching</h2>
        <p>
            I lecture undergraduate and graduate students in physiotherapy and sports science, with a focus on topics such as geriatrics, clinical practice, and research methodology.
            I advocate for active learning and emphasize the importance of hands-on, focused, and project-based education.
            I also supervise both bachelor's and master's theses.<br>
            <em>To students: I try to address research project, intership or lecture questions as much as possible.</em>
